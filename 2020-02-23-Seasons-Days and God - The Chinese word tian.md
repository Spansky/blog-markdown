My Chinese teacher taught some new words for talking about seasons via a Wechat call in February. Looks not so hard to remember as the last part tiān (day, heaven, god) is quite easy to write and pronounce, so just for the first part it seems like I have to think about some mnemonics. 

English | German | Chinese   | Pinyin
--------| --- |-----------|----------
Spring  | Frühling |春天       |chūntiān
Summer  | Sommer |夏天       |xiàtiān
Autumn  | Herbst |秋天       |qiūtiān
Winter  | Winter |冬天       |dōngtiān

Some related words I have already learned some time ago. 

English   | German | Chinese   | Pinyin
--------  | ---  |-----------|----------
yesterday | gestern  |昨天       |zuótiān
today     | heute  |今天       |jīntiān
tomorrow  | morgen  |明天       |míngtiān
someday     | eines Tages | 有一天 | yǒuyītiān
everyday    | jeden Tag | 每天 | měitiān

and last but not least:

English   | German | Chinese   | Pinyin
--------  | ---  |-----------|----------
Oh my god | Oh mein Gott  |我的天啊       |wǒdetiānā

Interesting is that in Chinese somehow it makes sense that the words are related. It seems like time and seasons are very related to the clouds in the air and also god makes sense in that context.
