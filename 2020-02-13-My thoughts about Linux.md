Today I gave a small Linux introduction to my colleagues and put it here in case someone else is interested...

## Some background info

* The Linux kernel got developed as OpenSource in the beginning of the 90s and is simimlar to UNIX
* a lot of Software Developers on the world are enhancing it and are building some components on top of it (e.g. the commandline bash or normal software, but also graphical user interfaces, like a desktop) because the kernel is not suitable/usable alone
* The kernel runs on a lot of hardware such as mobile devices, but also digital cameras, routers, etc. 
* There are so called Linux Distributions - e.g. Ubuntu, Android, Debian, Centos, SUSE Linux,... these are broadly spread combinations of kernel and components on top of it

## My personal view on Linux and how it changed over time 

* The first contact I made with Linux was when my windows PC was not working anymore and my uncle suggested to use a rescue CD to backup my files. This rescue disc was based on Linux. I then tried out to install it as a main system, but quickly resigned because the process of installing software was too difficult for me at that time (I think I was around 12-14) and it was not possible to play computer games for Windows (:(). Also my internet was not really fast and open source software was mainly distributed via the internet.

    __My summary at this time: Linux at this time sucked!__
    
* With 17 I bought my first Macbook because I decided it would be better for me as it will keep me concentrated as no games are running on it (in 2008). At this time I already ended my first computer nerd era and I was using my macbook to mainly surf the internet, watch movies etc. without having to worry about anti-virus software. At this time I shifted from beeing a nerd to beeing a party animal :) So I did not program anything on it between 17-23 (except some mandatory homework for my bachelor, mainly using Eclipse as IDE). However as the Macbook's OS is Unix-based and therefore a lot of cmd line commands are similar to linux. Those I needed in the next era of my computer nerdy times...

* in 2017 I had the idea to start programming again when I was in a hotel in Beijing and it was smoggy outside. This was when I worked on a PLC Simulator. I did this on my Windows laptop first and then figured out that I cannot simulate more than 1000 PLCs because my programmed tool (Python) in Windows could only handle 1024 threads at the same time. I've read in the internet that there is a method to handle more threads but this method is using some linux internal driver that does not exist in Windows. Therefore it was time to switch the OS. 

* Considering Linux again was this time not so much of a change for me due to my Mac. I got access to a Linux System in my company. It turned out that most command line commands where similar like on a Mac system. The internet was much more faster than when I was young and a lot of package managers made it quite easy to install software just by typing in one line. Actually I feel now like installing software in linux is easier than in Windows. Less clicks and fully automatible by just using a text file. 

    __New Summary: Linux is OK__

* Working more and more in linux helped me to get a better understanding. Hosting the Simulator gave me a lot of touchpoints.

* The breaktrough for me in linux began when last year I decided I want to have my own website to learn more and more. 

    __New Summary (for me): Linux first, don't start developing on Windows, if you are creating web based software or mobile apps__ 
    
## Pro's & Con's
+ __Pro__: Most of the software is for free (as long as you do not have some service contracts) and comes with licences that allow you commercial use (e.g. MIT-license)
+ __Pro__: Scalable operating system due to license model -> let's say you have 100 instances of a microsservice running using linux -> 0â‚¬ software costs
+ __Pro__: Increasing number of users and active contributors in the internet communities. You will find for a lot of server applications more advices for Linux than for Windows. 
+ __Pro__: Customizable - as the source code is open, you can easily tweak it, if you need to - this applies for all open source projects. 
+ __Pro__: Size of images can be cut down to basic functionality
+ __Pro__: Knowing Linux becomes a more required skill for IT people in most companies. Check out LinkedIn or other job platforms.
- __Con's__: A lot of people grew up with Windows, __but__ this is currently even changing (is your child / a friends child using a windows system when it is playing on your mobile phone or tablet?).

## Microsofts Reaction on more and more popular open source projects and Linux (my personal opinion)

* Linux can now be integrated into Windows 10 - you can install distributions from the Microsoft Store
* by this they avoid that people switch from Windows to Linux just to have the linux functions available
* it is a clever move from Microsoft to keep the Windows users in their ecosystem and at the same time allowing them to use Linux
* Microsoft is switching more and more into open source aswell -> see Visual Studio Code

## My suggestions
* Learn to use Linux/Unix and make the tools bundled with it your best friend
* Don't waste time on the MS Powershell or the Windows command line, if there is no need to
